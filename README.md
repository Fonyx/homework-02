# Refactoring Homework

# general refactoring approach
In the homework my main goals were 
    -to replace as many div tags with semantic tags as was reasonably and positively possible
    -to reduce css repetition through seperation of class and id tags in the html
    -adding seo improvements through meta tags and title tags

# specific refactors
Semantic tags used;
    -header
    -nav
    -figure
    -section
    -article
    -footer
